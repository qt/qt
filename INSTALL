        INSTALLING Qt Source Package Version %VERSION%.

1.  If you have the commercial edition of Qt, install your license
    file as $HOME/.qt-license if you are on Unix. If you are on
    Windows, copy the license file into your home directory
    (this may be known as the userprofile environment variable) and
    rename it to .qt-license. For example on Windows XP,
    %USERPROFILE% should be something like C:\Documents and
    Settings\username.

    For the open source version you do not need a license file.

2.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

    On Unix (X11 and Mac):
        cd /tmp
        gunzip %DISTNAME%.tar.gz        # uncompress the archive
        tar xvf %DISTNAME%.tar          # unpack it

    This creates the directory /tmp/%DISTNAME% containing the files
    from the archive. We only support the GNU version of the tar
    archiving utility. Note that on some systems it is called gtar.

    On Windows, uncompress the files into the directory you want Qt
    installed, e.g. C:\Qt\%VERSION%.

    NOTE: The install path must not contain any spaces.

4. Environment variables

   In order to build and use Qt, the PATH environment variable needs
   to be extended to locate qmake, moc and other Qt tools

   On Windows, this is done by adding C:\Qt\%VERSION%\bin
   to the PATH variable. On Unix, this is done by adding
   /tmp/%DISTNAME%.

   For newer versions of Windows, PATH can be extended through
   "Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment variables" and for
   older versions by editing C:\autoexec.bat.

   In .profile (if your Unix shell is bash), add the following lines:

        PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH
        export PATH

   In .login (in case your Unix shell is csh or tcsh), add the following line:

        setenv PATH /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/bin:$PATH

   If you use a different Unix shell, please modify your environment
   variables accordingly.

   For some X11 compilers that do not support rpath you must also
   extended the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include
   /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION%/lib. On Linux or Mac with GCC
   this step is not needed.

4.  Building

4.1 Building on Unix

    To configure the Qt library for your machine type, run the
    ./configure script in the package directory.

    By default, Qt is configured for installation in the
    /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-%VERSION% directory, but this can be
    changed by using the -prefix option.

        cd /tmp/%DISTNAME%
        ./configure

    Type "./configure -help" to get a list of all available options.

    To create the library and compile all the demos, examples, tools,
    and tutorials, type:

        make

    If you did not configure Qt using the -prefix-install option,
    you need to install the library, demos, examples, tools, and
    tutorials in the appropriate place. To do this, type:

        su -c "make install"

    and enter the root password. On some systems, you have to use the
    sudo command as follows:

        sudo make install

    and enter your password, this requires that you have administrator access
    to your machine.

    Note that on some systems the make utility is named differently,
    e.g. gmake. The configure script tells you which make utility to
    use.

    If you need to reconfigure and rebuild Qt from the same location,
    ensure that all traces of the previous configuration are removed
    by entering the build directory and typing

        make confclean

    before running the configure script again.

4.2 Building on Windows

    To configure the Qt library for your machine type:

        C:
        cd \Qt\%VERSION%
        configure

    Type "configure -help" to get a list of all available options.

    If you are using the "-direct3d" option, make sure that you have
    the Direct3D SDK installed, and that you have run the
    %DXSDK_DIR%\Utilities\Bin\dx_setenv.cmd command, before attempting
    to run configure.

    The actual commands needed to build Qt depends on your development
    system. For Microsoft Visual Studio to create the library and
    compile all the demos, examples, tools and tutorials type:

        nmake

    If you need to reconfigure and rebuild Qt from the same location,
    ensure that all traces of the previous configuration are removed
    by entering the build directory and typing

        nmake confclean

    before running the configure script again.

5.  That's all. Qt is now installed.

    If you are new to Qt, we suggest that you take a look at the demos
    and examples to see Qt in action. Run the Qt Examples and Demos
    either by typing 'qtdemo' on the command line or through the
    desktop's Start menu.
