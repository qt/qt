    \brief The Qt3Support module provides classes that ease porting
    from Qt 3 to Qt 4.

    \warning The classes in this module are intended to be used in
    intermediate stages of a porting process and are not intended
    to be used in production code.

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qt3support.qdoc 0

    To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
    .pro file:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qt3support.qdoc 1

    \note Since this module provides compatibility classes for
    diverse parts of the Qt 3 API, it has dependencies on the QtCore,
    QtGui, QtNetwork, QtSql, and QtXml modules.

    This module is part of the \l{Qt Full Framework Edition} and the
    \l{Open Source Versions of Qt}. Most classes offered by this module are
    also part of the \l{Qt GUI Framework Edition}.
\if defined(opensourceedition) || defined(desktoplightedition)
    Classes that are not available for \l{Qt GUI Framework Edition}
    users are marked as such in the class documentation.
