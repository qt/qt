*                   Important Behavior Changes                             *
****************************************************************************

QtScript: Changes due to updating src/3rdparty/javascriptcore:
 - It is no longer possible to delete an undeletable property from C++
   using QScriptValue::setProperty().
 - The QScriptEngineAgent::positionChange() callback will always report
   a column number of 1.
 - QScriptValueIterator will include the "length" property when iterating
   over Array objects.

QtCore:
  - QChar no longer carries the Q_PACKED tag on ARM. This flag was
    used to allow proper alignment of QChar on 2 bytes on older ARM
    ABIs, but it also allowed for unaligned access. Qt never generates
    or uses unaligned access and the new EABI aligns as expected, so
    the flag was removed.

QtNetwork:
  - Qt does no longer provide its own CA bundle, but uses system APIs for
    retrieving the default system certificates. On Symbian,
    QSslSocket::systemCaCertificates() provides an empty list of
    certificates.
