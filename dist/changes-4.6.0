****************************************************************************
*                      Platform Specific Changes                           *
****************************************************************************

 - Added community supported Qt ports for QNX and VxWorks. See platform
   notes in the Qt documentation for details.

 - Significant external contribution from Milan Burda for planned removal
   of (non-unicode) Windows 9x/ME support.

 - QRegion is no longer a GDI object by default. This means it is no
   longer subject to gui-thread only nor does it potentially impact
   the 10.000 GDI object limit per process. By explicitly calling
   .handle() a GDI object will be created and memory managed by
   QRegion. The native handle is for reading out only. Any GDI calls
   made on the HRGN handle will not affect the QRegion.

 - [259221] QFileInfo::symLinkTarget() now supports NTFS symbolic links
   thanks to Konstantin Ritt (merge request 1217).

 - The reading code of QLocalSocket on Windows has been rewritten to improve
   reading performance.

 - On Windows CE the link time code geration has been disabled by default to
   be consistent with win32-msvc200x.

 - The default button size has been reduced in the Windows mobile style.

 - [QTBUG-3613] QWizard issues have been fixed on Windows mobile.
   
 - Added QMAKE_LIBS_OPENGL_ES1, QMAKE_LIBS_OPENGL_ES1CL and
   QMAKE_LIBS_OPENGL_ES2 qmake variables for specifying OpenGL ES
   specific libraries.

 - KDE Integration: Improved the integration into KDE desktop (loading of KDE
   palette, usage of KColorDialog and KFileDialog) using the GuiPlatformPlugin

 - Phonon on Windows
   * Now much more reliable when reading a file through a QIODevice.
   * If Video Mixing Renderer 9 is not available, falls back to software 
     rendering.
   * Fixed a flicker issue when switching source with a transition time of 0

 - [259238] Fixed menubar/menu editing in right-to-left mode.
 - [259918] Fixed setting of object names for container pages not to use
            localized strings.
 - [260658] Fixed saving of alpha values set in the palette editor.
 -          It is now possible to further specify the kind of custom widget
            string properties using XML tags.

****************************************************************************
*                               DirectFB                                   *
****************************************************************************

 - When running Qt/DirectFB the DirectFB window id of a top level QWidget can
   be queried using property("_q_DirectFBWindowID")

 - Allow setting the background color of the primary layer in DirectFB with
   connect options. QWS_DISPLAY=directfb:bgcolor=red or
   QWS_DISPLAY=directfb:bgcolor=\#aabbccdd

 - Add support for rendering mouse cursor using a top level window when cursor
   support is not working in IDirectFBDisplayLayer. Define
   QT_DIRECTFB_WINDOW_AS_CURSOR to enable.

 - Add experimental support for optimized locking/unlocking of surfaces. Enable
   by defining QT_DIRECTFB_SUBSURFACE.

 - Fix a bug to conceptually allow using QDirectFBScreen as a subscreen of a
   proxy screen. Don't make QDirectFBScreen::instance() assume that
   QScreen::instance() is a QDirectFBScreen.

 - Optimize move/resize operations with DirectFB. With a properly configured
   DirectFB these operations are handled for us and we don't need to force a
   repaint of the window.

 - Support top level window opacity in DirectFB

 - Fix a bug when loading RGB32 images that would lead to rendering issues.

 - Fix a bug when painting with invalid pens/brushes.

 - Fix a bug that would show up when QWidget::scroll is called.

 - Implement support for loading pixmaps using IDirectFBImageProvider.

 - Disable color table support by default. This seems to work incorrectly on
   most boards and loading these images will generally require an image
   conversion anyway.

 - Fix a bug regarding QGraphicsProxyWidgets

 - Fix a crash when resizing windows

 - Compile with versions < 1.0. We still recommend using newer versions.

 - Considerable code cleanup

 - Various optimizations regarding painting, loading of images and creation of
   surfaces.

 - Allow forcibly falling back to raster engine for painting operations by
   exporting QT_DIRECTFB_FORCE_RASTER=1

 - Reenable support for RGB32 primary surface.


****************************************************************************
* Important Behavior Changes *
****************************************************************************

 - The experimental Direct3D paint engine has been removed. The reason for
   this is that Nokia focuses on OpenGL for desktop hardware accelerated
   rendering.

 - The default engine used to draw onto OpenGL buffers has changed in
   Qt 4.6. The QPaintEngine::OpenGL2 engine is now used as the default
   engine. This *may* cause compatibility problems for applications
   that use a mix of QPainter and native OpenGL calls to draw into a GL
   buffer. Use the QGL::setPreferredPaintEngine() function to enforce
   usage of the old GL paint engine.

 - When mixing OpenGL and QPainter calls you need to surround your
   custom OpenGL calls with QPainter::beginNativePainting() and
   QPainter::endNativePainting().
   This is to ensure that the paint engine flushes any pending drawing and sets
   up the GL modelview/projection matrices properly before you can issue custom
   OpenGL calls, and to let the paint engine synchronize to the painter state
   before resuming regular QPainter based drawing.

 - Graphics View has undergone heavy optimization work, and as a result of
   this work, the following behavior changes were introduced.

   a) QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::exposedRect now contains the item's bounding
      rectangle, and QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::matrix is uninitialized by
      default. You can enable an exact exposed rectangle and a correct matrix
      by enabling the flag QGraphicsItem::ItemUsesExtendedStyleOptions.

   b) QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::levelOfDetails is obsoleted and its value is
      always initialized to 1. Instead you can call
      QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::levelOfDetailFromTransform(const QTransform &)
      to determine the level of detail.

   c) QGraphicsView no longer calls QGraphicsView::drawItems(), and in turn
      QGraphicsScene::drawItems(), by default. You can get the old behavior
      back by enabling QGraphicsView::IndirectPainting.

   d) QGraphicsItem no longer calls itemChange() for position and
      transformation changes. If you want to receive notifications for changes
      to the item's position and transformation, you can set the flag
      QGraphicsItem::ItemSendsGeometryChanges (which is enabled by default by
      QGraphicsWidget and QGraphicsProxyWidget).

 - QDesktopWidget on X11 no longer emits the resized(int) signal when screens
   are added or removed. This was not done on other platforms. Use the
   screenCountChanged signal instead

 - QUrl's parser is more strict when for hostnames in URLs. QUrl now
   enforces STD 3 rules:

    * each individual hostname section (between dots) must be at most
      63 ASCII characters in length;

    * only letters, digits, and the hyphen character are allowed in the
      ASCII range; letters outside the ASCII range follow the normal
      IDN rules

   That means QUrl no longer accepts some URLs that were invalid
   before, but weren't interpreted as such.

 - The Unix configure-time check for STL is stricter now in Qt
   4.6.0. This means some legacy STL implementations may fail to pass
   the test and, therefore, Qt will automatically disable STL support.

   This is a binary-compatible change: existing code will continue to
   work without being recompiled. However, it affects the source code,
   since some STL-compatibility API will not be enabled.

   Platforms affected by this change:
     * solaris-cc-* with the default (Cstd) C++ STL library
       recommendation: use -library=stlport4
       See Sun Studio's documentation for the effects of this option

 - QVariant has now a new implicit constructor that takes a float. This
   means that code that assigned a float to a variant would create a
   variant with userType QMetaType::Float, instead of QVariant::Double.

 - QDataStream will now read and write all floating point numbers with the
   same precision, regardless of whether it's streamed into or out from a
   float or double. This is to maintain compatibility across platforms with
   a different default precision for qreal. The default is 64-bit precision
   for all floating point numbers, and this can be changed using the new
   function setFloatingPointPrecision(). Set Qt_4_5 as the version of the
   QDataStream to get the behavior of previous versions.

 - On Mac OS X, QDesktopServices::storageLocation(DataLocation) now includes
   QCoreApplication::organizationName() and QCoreApplication::applicationName()
   if those are set. This matches the behavior on the other platforms.
   
 - The Animation Framework
   * currentTime() now returns the complete current time including previous loops
   * currentLoopTime() returns the time inside the current loop
   * stateChanged signal sends the new state as first parameter and old state as
     the second
   * QAnimationGroup::clearAnimations() has been renames to clear()
   * QAnimationGroup::insertAnimationAt() has been renames to insertAnimation()
   * QAnimationGroup::takeAnimationAt() has been renames to takeAnimation()
   * QSequentialAnimationGroup::insertPauseAt() has been renames to insertPause()
