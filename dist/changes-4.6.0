 - The experimental Direct3D paint engine has been removed. The
   reasons for this is that Qt Software focuses on OpenGL for desktop
   hardware accelerated rendering.

 - QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::exposedRect and QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::matrix
   does no longer contain fine-grained values when passed in drawItems()/paint()
   unless the QGraphicsItem::ItemUsesExtendedStyleOptions flag is enabled.
   By default, exposedRect is initialized to the item's bounding rect
   and the matrix is untransformed.

 - QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::levelOfDetails is obsoleted and its value
   is always initialized to 1. For a more fine-grained value use
   QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::levelOfDetailFromTransform(const QTransform &).

 - When mixing OpenGL and QPainter calls you need to first call syncState()
   on the paint engine, for example "painter->paintEngine()->syncState()".
   This is to ensure that the engine flushes any pending drawing and sets up
   the GL modelview/projection matrices properly.
