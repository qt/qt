****************************************************************************
*                      Platform Specific Changes                           *
****************************************************************************

 - Added community supported Qt ports for QNX and VxWorks. See platform
   notes in the Qt documentation for details.

 - Improved support for AIX using IBM's Visual Age C/C++ compiler
   version 7 (xlC).

 - Improved support for Solaris using Sun Studio 12 (CC 5.9).

Qt for Unix (X11 and Mac OS X)
------------------------------

 - Added support for thread-safe FD_CLOEXEC file-descriptor creation
   where supported by the operating system (currently only Linux).

 - Ensured that system calls where EINTR is a possible result are
   properly restarted.

Qt for Linux/X11
----------------

 - KDE Integration: Improved the integration into KDE desktop (loading of KDE
   palette, usage of KColorDialog and KFileDialog) using the GuiPlatformPlugin

 - Fixed pasting the clipboard content to non-Qt application on X11 when the
   requested format is image/ppm. Patch by Ritt.K

 - On X11 Qt now supports the _NET_WM_SYNC protocol.

 - On X11 Qt now supports the SAVE_TARGET protocol that allows to keep
   clipboard contents if the application that owns the clipboards exits

 - [QTBUG-4652] On X11 clipboard content can be properly retrieved even when an
   application asks the unsupported target. This fixes copying and pasting data
   when using Synergy.
 - [MR#797] Fixed a crash when using QX11EmbedContainer/Widget on x86_64.
 - [MR#1111] Emit workAreaResized when _NET_WORKAREA is changed on X11.

 - Improved EGL integration on X11 (including better visual selection).

 - Support Qt::WA_TranslucentBackground on top-level QGLWidgets on X11, both 
   (EGL & glX). This allows OpenGL (& ES) rendering to semi-transparent widgets
   if a compositing window manager is running.

 - Support OpenGL texture_from_pixmap extension on X11 (EGL & glX) when
   calling QPainter::drawPixmap() with the OpenGL paint engine, or calling
   QGLContext::bindTexture() on an X11 QPixmap. If the 
   GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap or EGL_NOKIA_texture_from_pixmap extensions are
   present, Qt will attempt to use glXBindTexImageEXT or eglBindTexImage to
   bind the pixmap to a texture, rather than copying the pixel data.

 - Add new experimental QX11GLPixmapData backend for QPixmap. This pixmap
   backend uses regular X11 pixmaps to store the image data, however it uses
   OpenGL to render into them.

 - Tablet: Disable event compression of events of type QTabletEvent when the
   current event is accepted by the receiver.

Qt for Windows
--------------

 - Significant external contribution from Milan Burda for planned removal
   of (non-unicode) Windows 9x/ME support.

 - QRegion is no longer a GDI object by default. This means it is no
   longer subject to gui-thread only nor does it potentially impact
   the 10.000 GDI object limit per process. By explicitly calling
   .handle() a GDI object will be created and memory managed by
   QRegion. The native handle is for reading out only. Any GDI calls
   made on the HRGN handle will not affect the QRegion.

 - The reading code of QLocalSocket on Windows has been rewritten to improve
   reading performance.

 - On Windows when a file cannot be accessed (stat()ed), we are now restoring
   the error mode to the original value.

 - [259221] QFileInfo::symLinkTarget() now supports NTFS symbolic links
   thanks to Konstantin Ritt (merge request 1217).
 - [251554] Fixed openUrl("mailto:") with Thunderbird on Windows.
 - [254501] QDestopServices now supports cyrillic file names.
 - Fixed an issue which prevents moving fixed size windows using titlebar.
 - [258087] Fixed an issue on Vista which returns incorrect file paths when using
   QFileDialog::getOpenFileNames()
 - [253763] Fixed a focus issue when using out-of-process ActiveQt controls.
 - [255912] Mouse move events will not be delivered to a blocked widget.
 - [225588] Enabled IME reconversion support.

 - Phonon on Windows
   * Now much more reliable when reading a file through a QIODevice.
   * If Video Mixing Renderer 9 is not available, falls back to software
     rendering.
   * Fixed a flicker issue when switching source with a transition time of 0

Qt for Mac OS X
---------------

 - Add support for GetURL events on Mac OS X
 - [123740] Fixed an issue with dead keys on Mac (cocoa) on French keyboard layout.

 - [QTBUG-4418] Fixed maximizing and restoring a window on Mac.

General changes on Mac OS X:
 - Mac OS X version support: Support for 10.3(Panther) has been dropped, support for
   10.6(Snow Leopard) has been added.
 - The Cocoa port now supports static linking.
 - The Cocoa port now supports the Qt3Support library (with the exception of Q3FileDialog)
   to ease the transition from Carbon to Cocoa.
 - The Cocoa binary packages are now Intel only (universal i386 and x86_64).
 - Snow Leopard notes:
    - Gcc 4.2 is used by default. Configure with -platform macx-g++40 to select 4.0.
    - Using the 10.4u SDK requires gcc 4.0.
    - Configuring for the Cocoa port (-cocoa) produces 64-bit binaries by default.
      Use the -arch flags to override.
    - Building for ppc64 is no longer supported by the gcc tool chain.
    - Building for ppc is still supported.

Cocoa:
- Fixed stacking order of modal dialogs so that they never rearrange level, or
  hide in the background.
- Fixed problem with plugins written with Qt that closes down the native application
  when hiding a modal dialog.
- Fixed problem that native applications cannot quit when using plugins written with
  Qt from a native application.
- Fixed problem that the menubar is not restored correctly when using plugins written
  with Qt from a native application.
- The event dispatcher now integrates better with native applications that spins the
  event loop them selves.
- Using Qt::AA_MacPluginApplication will now disable the use of native menubars on mac.
- Sliders and scroll views in Qt now uses pixel scrolling for mouse devices
  that supports this.
- Wheel events can now contain a delta with a value as low as 1 for mouse devices that
  uses pixel scrolling.

Qt for Embedded Linux

  QMAKE_LIBS_OPENGL_ES2 qmake variables for specifying OpenGL ES
  specific libraries.

- Compilation fixes for OpenGL/ES 1.0 and OpenGL/ES 1.1 Common Lite.

- EGL and OpenGL/ES
   * Protect the use of version-specific EGL symbols with #ifdef's.
   * Make sure an EGL context is current when resolving GL extensions.
   * Introduce "lazyDoneCurrent" for optimizing context switching in
     paint engines.
   * Separate EGLSurface from QEglContext so that the same context can
     be used with multiple surfaces.
   * Move common functions from system-specific files to qgl_egl.cpp.
   * Fix a memory leak of EGLSurface's in QGLContext.
   * Fix detection of pbuffers on OpenGL/ES systems.
   * EGL_SAMPLES was being set to the wrong value for multisampled surfaces.

   * Make the code better at detecting MBX vs SGX header files.
   * Fix 32-bit screen support - some code was still assuming 16-bit.
   * Stop GL window surfaces double-flushing their contents.
   * Remove surface holder, which never worked all that well.
   * Implement screen rotations.

- Send enter/leave events also to child widgets

- Fix crash when instantiating multiple QApplications

- Optimize software cursor by using native image format instead of 8-bit

- [255828] Avoid window decoration flicker on show

- [255495] Fix blend function crash on AVR32

****************************************************************************
*                               DirectFB                                   *
****************************************************************************

 - When running Qt/DirectFB the DirectFB window id of a top level QWidget can
   be queried using property("_q_DirectFBWindowID")

 - Allow setting the background color of the primary layer in DirectFB with
   connect options. QWS_DISPLAY=directfb:bgcolor=red or
   QWS_DISPLAY=directfb:bgcolor=\#aabbccdd

 - Add support for rendering mouse cursor using a top level window when cursor
   support is not working in IDirectFBDisplayLayer. Define
   QT_DIRECTFB_WINDOW_AS_CURSOR to enable.

 - Add experimental support for optimized locking/unlocking of surfaces. Enable
   by defining QT_DIRECTFB_SUBSURFACE.

 - Fix a bug to conceptually allow using QDirectFBScreen as a subscreen of a
   proxy screen. Don't make QDirectFBScreen::instance() assume that
   QScreen::instance() is a QDirectFBScreen.

 - Optimize move/resize operations with DirectFB. With a properly configured
   DirectFB these operations are handled for us and we don't need to force a
   repaint of the window.

 - Support top level window opacity in DirectFB

 - Fix a bug when painting with invalid pens/brushes.

 - Fix a bug that would show up when QWidget::scroll is called.

 - Implement support for loading pixmaps using IDirectFBImageProvider.

 - Disable color table support by default. This seems to work incorrectly on
   most boards and loading these images will generally require an image
   conversion anyway.

 - Fix a bug regarding QGraphicsProxyWidgets

 - Fix a crash when resizing windows

 - Compile with versions < 1.0. We still recommend using newer versions.

 - Considerable code cleanup

 - Various optimizations regarding painting, loading of images and creation of
   surfaces.

 - Allow forcibly falling back to raster engine for painting operations by
   exporting QT_DIRECTFB_FORCE_RASTER=1

 - Reenable support for RGB32 primary surface.


****************************************************************************
* Important Behavior Changes *
****************************************************************************

 - The experimental Direct3D paint engine has been removed. The reason for
   this is that Nokia focuses on OpenGL for desktop hardware accelerated
   rendering.

 - The default engine used to draw onto OpenGL buffers has changed in
   Qt 4.6. The QPaintEngine::OpenGL2 engine is now used as the default
   engine. This *may* cause compatibility problems for applications
   that use a mix of QPainter and native OpenGL calls to draw into a GL
   buffer. Use the QGL::setPreferredPaintEngine() function to enforce
   usage of the old GL paint engine.

 - When mixing OpenGL and QPainter calls you need to surround your
   custom OpenGL calls with QPainter::beginNativePainting() and
   QPainter::endNativePainting().
   This is to ensure that the paint engine flushes any pending drawing and sets
   up the GL modelview/projection matrices properly before you can issue custom
   OpenGL calls, and to let the paint engine synchronize to the painter state
   before resuming regular QPainter based drawing.

 - Graphics View has undergone heavy optimization work, and as a result of
   this work, the following behavior changes were introduced.

   a) QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::exposedRect now contains the item's bounding
      rectangle, and QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::matrix is uninitialized by
      default. You can enable an exact exposed rectangle and a correct matrix
      by enabling the flag QGraphicsItem::ItemUsesExtendedStyleOptions.

   b) QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::levelOfDetails is obsoleted and its value is
      always initialized to 1. Instead you can call
      QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::levelOfDetailFromTransform(const QTransform &)
      to determine the level of detail.

   c) QGraphicsView no longer calls QGraphicsView::drawItems(), and in turn
      QGraphicsScene::drawItems(), by default. You can get the old behavior
      back by enabling QGraphicsView::IndirectPainting.

   d) QGraphicsItem no longer calls itemChange() for position and
      transformation changes. If you want to receive notifications for changes
      to the item's position and transformation, you can set the flag
      QGraphicsItem::ItemSendsGeometryChanges (which is enabled by default by
      QGraphicsWidget and QGraphicsProxyWidget).

 - QDesktopWidget on X11 no longer emits the resized(int) signal when screens
   are added or removed. This was not done on other platforms. Use the
   screenCountChanged signal instead

 - QUrl's parser is more strict when for hostnames in URLs. QUrl now
   enforces STD 3 rules:

    * each individual hostname section (between dots) must be at most
      63 ASCII characters in length;

    * only letters, digits, and the hyphen character are allowed in the
      ASCII range; letters outside the ASCII range follow the normal
      IDN rules

   That means QUrl no longer accepts some URLs that were invalid
   before, but weren't interpreted as such.

 - The Unix configure-time check for STL is stricter now in Qt
   4.6.0. This means some legacy STL implementations may fail to pass
   the test and, therefore, Qt will automatically disable STL support.

   This is a binary-compatible change: existing code will continue to
   work without being recompiled. However, it affects the source code,
   since some STL-compatibility API will not be enabled.

   Platforms affected by this change:
     * solaris-cc-* with the default (Cstd) C++ STL library
       recommendation: use -library=stlport4
       See Sun Studio's documentation for the effects of this option

 - QVariant has now a new implicit constructor that takes a float. This
   means that code that assigned a float to a variant would create a
   variant with userType QMetaType::Float, instead of QVariant::Double.

 - QDataStream will now read and write all floating point numbers with the
   same precision, regardless of whether it's streamed into or out from a
   float or double. This is to maintain compatibility across platforms with
   a different default precision for qreal. The default is 64-bit precision
   for all floating point numbers, and this can be changed using the new
   function setFloatingPointPrecision(). Set Qt_4_5 as the version of the
   QDataStream to get the behavior of previous versions.

 - On Mac OS X, QDesktopServices::storageLocation(DataLocation) now includes
   QCoreApplication::organizationName() and QCoreApplication::applicationName()
   if those are set. This matches the behavior on the other platforms.

 - The Animation Framework
   * currentTime() now returns the complete current time including previous loops
   * currentLoopTime() returns the time inside the current loop
   * stateChanged signal sends the new state as first parameter and old state as
     the second
   * QAnimationGroup::clearAnimations() has been renames to clear()
   * QAnimationGroup::insertAnimationAt() has been renames to insertAnimation()
   * QAnimationGroup::takeAnimationAt() has been renames to takeAnimation()
   * QSequentialAnimationGroup::insertPauseAt() has been renames to insertPause()

- Refactoring in OpenGL examples to improve portability and utilize the
  Animation framework for animation.  The hellogl and overpainting examples
  now compile on OpenGL/ES 1.1.  Also common code is factored.
