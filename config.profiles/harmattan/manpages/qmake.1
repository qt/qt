.SH NAME
qmake \- cross-platform makefile generator for Qt

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmake
.I "[mode] [options] [files]"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B qmake
has two modes, one mode for generating project files based on some
heuristics, and the other for generating makefiles. Normally you
shouldn't need to specify a mode, as makefile generation is the default
mode for qmake, but you may use this to test qmake on an existing
project.
